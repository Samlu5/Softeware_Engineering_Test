Classes	and Inheritance	: Good class names, but the draw method should be included within the subclasses - 7
Encapsulation : All fields are public. Access to fields should be restricted to the minimum necessary, due to the risk
that external code might not understand how those fields are used internally, potentially leading to them going outside
of a valid range. Give them 'private' visibility and access them from getters and setters. If they are in a superclass
and need access from the subclass, make them 'protected'. - 2
Polymorphism : Correctly adding entities to a list, but you should include a draw method in the entity superclass, and
override this in each class of entity, this is better than identifying the type of the object in a list of objects - 6
Exceptions and Error handling : Errors are handled, but it would be better if you showed an error message which was
relevant to the LocationSystem - 9
Organization : No packages - 0
Attempt : Solid attempt, but the unable to run the submitted code - 4
Flexibility for Future : Uses an ArrayList for the superclass only - 7
Alerts : No alerts - 0
